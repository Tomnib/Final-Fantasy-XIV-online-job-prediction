Measured stats include: 
level, autoAttack, delay, Strength, Vitality,CriticalHit, Determination, Tenacity, SkillSpeed, DirectHitRate, Dexterity, Intelligence, SpellSpeed, Mind, Piety

Used a type of supervised learning algorithm called Decision Tree
  Best to use because I can give my model specific stat values to train with 
  Decision trees classify the examples by sorting them down the tree from the root to some leaf/terminal node, with the leaf/terminal node providing the classification of the        example.
